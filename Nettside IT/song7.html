                    <p data-aos = "fade-in">The summery song sees Lamar and Dre pay homage to the City of Angels as well as giving their recipe for the finer things in life. Kendrick and Dre explained to Power 106's Big Boy the meaning behind the tune. "'The Recipe,' it's one of those things that everyone in the world can relate to," said Lamar.
                    </p>
                    <p>The original title was 'Women, Weed and Weather.' That's what represents L.A," added Dre. "That's the three things you need in life; that's the recipe you need in life," concluded Lamar..
                     </p>
                    <p>Lamar filmed the video at a mansion in the Los Angeles area in May 2012, and he explained to MTV News his vision behind the clip. "I felt like there hasn't been that 'California Love'-type feel since the '90s, and I really wanted to display that and represent where I'm from," he said. "So I had a whole bunch of beautiful women, good weather — it was like 85 degrees and breezy — and we had [ScHoolboy] Q up in there stealing some of Snoop's weed, him and Ab-Soul, and we had fun."</p>
