                    <p data-aos = "fade-in">Throughout his first release in exactly 1,855 days, Kendrick muses on his many achievements covering a 19-year career, as well as the pitfalls of fame. He goes into great detail about his spending habits, real estate investments, luxury vehicles, and jewelry; he also discusses entering therapy to deal with mental health issues.</p>
                    <p>A section of the song that should be mentioned is the refrain, where the rapper repeats that he “grieve(s) different”. That assertion would obviously have something to do with the title. And all lyrics considered, perhaps what K-Dot is saying in this regard is that the way he deals with sadness is by going out and buying a lot of expensive sh*t.
                     </p>
                    <p>Notable mentions include his cousin and fellow PgLang artist, Baby Keem, as well as longtime friend and business partner, Dave Free</p>
