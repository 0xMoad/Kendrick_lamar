                                I think this album gets forgotten about because of how great the music released in 2016 was. Tlop, Coloring Book, Birds, Blond, Views (not saying it was great but it got more attention), Slime Season 3,Evol, Savage Mode, Still Brazy, Jeffrey and that’s not even including the releases from his own label in TDE from ScHoolboy with Blank Face and Isaiah Rashad with the Sun’s Tirade that it doesn’t get nearly the attention it should’ve. - Reddit user

What's so powerful about this project is the brazenness Kendrick has to probe into everyday stories that rarely generate dialogue in hip-hop
